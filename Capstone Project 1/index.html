    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there, I'm currently learning to develop websites.

      </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked firstly as a Trainee at a Landscaping Comapany (2019-2023). 
        Sadly i needed to quit this job due to health issues and weight loss surgery. 
        I didn't finish my apprenticeship, due to the earlyer meantioned healt issues.
        After my recovery, I started to work as a production worker at different companies through a temporary employment agency. 
        This has taught me adaptability, teamwork, and the ability to quickly learn new tasks in various environments.
